1. Install Required Packages for GUI
First, you attempted to install the graphical environment by using the following commands to install Xfce and the necessary graphical components.

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf groupinstall "Xfce" "X Window System" -y
However, these commands didn't work because the group Xfce and X Window System were not available. You then installed a minimal graphical environment manually by installing xorg-x11-server-Xvfb and other packages.

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install xorg-x11-server-Xvfb xterm -y
2. Install Chrome on Your Machine
You installed Google Chrome on your system so that Selenium tests can run in a GUI environment.

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install google-chrome-stable -y
If google-chrome is already installed, you can verify the installation by checking its version:

bash
Copy code
google-chrome --version
3. Install and Configure a Display Manager (LightDM)
Since you wanted a graphical user interface, you needed to install a display manager. First, you attempted to install LightDM (a lightweight display manager), but there were issues with installation because lightdm wasn't available in your current repositories.

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter -y
This failed due to package unavailability. As an alternative, you could either try GDM (GNOME Display Manager) or install Xfce.

4. Switching the Display Manager to LightDM
You were able to install LightDM and encountered an issue with enabling it because GDM (GNOME Display Manager) was already the default.

First, you disabled and stopped GDM to allow LightDM to take over as the default display manager:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl disable gdm
sudo systemctl stop gdm
Then, you enabled LightDM and started it:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
sudo systemctl start lightdm
5. Verify the Setup
After completing the steps above, you should be able to access the graphical user interface by rebooting the system:

bash
Copy code
sudo reboot
Once your system reboots, you should see the LightDM login screen. You can now log in and start using the graphical interface.

Optional: Troubleshoot or Try GDM Instead
If LightDM wasn't working as expected, you can fall back on GDM, which is the default on many Linux systems. To enable GDM, you can use these commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable gdm
sudo systemctl start gdm
6. Selenium Tests with UI
With the graphical environment in place and Chrome installed, you can now run Selenium tests that require a UI environment.

Configure your DriverFactory class (which you already did) to use ChromeDriver.
Recap of Key Steps:
Install X11/Xfce and required GUI packages (you installed xorg-x11-server-Xvfb).
Install Google Chrome (google-chrome-stable).
Install and configure LightDM (or optionally GDM).
Disable GDM, enable LightDM, and reboot.
Run Selenium tests with a graphical user interface.
