**POM** stands for **Project Object Model** in Maven. It is the fundamental unit of work in Maven and is represented by an XML file named `pom.xml`. This file contains the configuration and details about the project, dependencies, build settings, and plugins.

### Key Elements of `pom.xml`

1. **Project Information**
   - Defines basic project metadata such as the project's name, version, description, and group ID.
   ```xml
   <groupId>com.example</groupId>
   <artifactId>my-project</artifactId>
   <version>1.0.0</version>
   ```

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Lists the libraries and frameworks the project depends on.
   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
           <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
           <version>4.12.0</version>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

3. **Build Configuration**
   - Specifies build plugins and settings to customize how the project is built.
   ```xml
   <build>
       <plugins>
           <plugin>
               <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
               <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
               <version>3.11.0</version>
               <configuration>
                   <source>11</source>
                   <target>11</target>
               </configuration>
           </plugin>
       </plugins>
   </build>
   ```

4. **Project Modules**
   - Supports modular development by managing sub-projects or modules.
   ```xml
   <modules>
       <module>module1</module>
       <module>module2</module>
   </modules>
   ```

5. **Profiles**
   - Defines different configurations (e.g., for different environments like development or production).
   ```xml
   <profiles>
       <profile>
           <id>dev</id>
           <properties>
               <env>development</env>
           </properties>
       </profile>
   </profiles>
   ```

### Importance of `pom.xml`

- Acts as a **blueprint** for building the project.
- Centralizes dependency and plugin management, reducing manual effort.
- Ensures a consistent and reproducible build process.
- Simplifies collaboration by allowing others to replicate the project environment with just the `pom.xml`.

In short, `pom.xml` is the heart of a Maven project.


Key Differences between Normal (Single-Module) and Multi-Module POMs:
Parent POM: Multi-module projects typically use a parent POM to define shared configurations, which child modules inherit.
Modules Section: In multi-module POM, the <modules> section is used to list the sub-projects (modules) that belong to the parent project.
Inheritance: Child modules inherit configurations like dependencies and plugin versions from the parent POM.
Dependency Management: In multi-module projects, dependency versions are often defined at the parent level and managed for child modules to avoid duplication.
Conclusion
Maven POM: A Maven POM file defines the project configuration, dependencies, plugins, and build instructions for Maven. It is essential for managing your project lifecycle.
Normal POM: Typically refers to a standard, single-module Maven project.
Multi-Module POM: Used for large projects that require multiple sub-modules to share common configurations and dependencies.
