    * Sure! Here's the comparison between **Hard Assertions** and **Soft Assertions** in a point-wise format:

### **Hard Assertions:**
1. **Execution Flow:**
   - Stops the test execution immediately when an assertion fails.
   - The subsequent assertions in the test are not executed if one fails.

2. **Assertion Methods:**
   - Uses standard assertion methods such as `Assert.assertTrue()`, `Assert.assertEquals()`, etc.

3. **Test Failure:**
   - The test case fails immediately when an assertion fails.
   - The test terminates right away on the first failure.

4. **Failure Handling:**
   - No further checks or assertions are executed after a failure.

5. **Use Case:**
   - Ideal for critical checks where failure at any point indicates that further tests are not meaningful.

6. **Example:**
   ```java
   Assert.assertTrue(5 > 6);  // Fails here, test stops
   Assert.assertTrue(10 > 5); // This line is never reached.
   ```

7. **Reporting:**
   - TestNG reports the failure immediately after the first failure is encountered.

8. **Impact on Test Case:**
   - The test case is considered a failure, and the test execution halts immediately.

---

### **Soft Assertions:**
1. **Execution Flow:**
   - The test continues to execute even if an assertion fails.
   - The subsequent assertions in the test are still executed even after a failure.

2. **Assertion Methods:**
   - Uses the `SoftAssert` class for assertions, such as `softAssert.assertTrue()`, `softAssert.assertEquals()`, etc.

3. **Test Failure:**
   - The test case does not fail immediately when an assertion fails.
   - Test only fails at the end if `assertAll()` is called, collecting all failures in one place.

4. **Failure Handling:**
   - Collects all assertion failures and does not terminate the test.
   - Failures are reported after invoking `softAssert.assertAll()`.

5. **Use Case:**
   - Ideal for non-critical checks where we want to execute all assertions and collect failure results at the end.

6. **Example:**
   ```java
   SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();
   softAssert.assertTrue(5 > 6);  // Fails here, but test continues
   softAssert.assertTrue(10 > 5); // This line is executed even after the first failure
   softAssert.assertAll(); // Reports all failures at the end
   ```

7. **Reporting:**
   - Failures are reported only when `softAssert.assertAll()` is called at the end.

8. **Impact on Test Case:**
   - The test case continues even if there are failures, and all failures are reported together after `assertAll()`.

---

### **Key Differences Summary:**
- **Test Execution on Failure:**
   - **Hard Assertion**: Stops immediately at the first failure.
   - **Soft Assertion**: Continues execution and reports all failures later.

- **When to Use:**
   - **Hard Assertion**: For critical validations where further execution doesnâ€™t make sense if one condition fails.
   - **Soft Assertion**: For non-critical validations where we want to collect all failures before failing the test.

- **Example Scenarios:**
   - **Hard Assertion**: Checking if a value is within a valid range (e.g., `Assert.assertTrue(age > 0);`).
   - **Soft Assertion**: Collecting multiple warnings or validations that can be checked together at the end of the test.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **Hard Assertions**: Stop test execution immediately upon failure and are used when the test can't proceed if a condition fails.
- **Soft Assertions**: Allow the test to continue and report all assertion failures after execution, useful for validating multiple conditions without terminating the test prematurely.

        Assert.assertEquals(5, 5);  // This will pass because 5 is equal to 5

        Assert.assertEquals(Integer.valueOf(5), Integer.valueOf(5));  // This will pass because Integer(5) equals Integer(5)

        Assert.assertNotEquals("Hello", "World");  // This will pass because "Hello" is not equal to "World"
        Assert.assertNotEquals(new int[]{1, 2, 3}, new int[]{1, 2, 4});  // This will fail because arrays are compared by reference, not value

        // 4. assertFalse - Hard Assertions
        Assert.assertFalse(5 > 6);  // This will pass because 5 is not greater than 6, so the condition is false
